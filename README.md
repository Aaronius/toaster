# Toaster Extension for Adobe Experience Platform Launch

This is a sample extension for [Adobe Experience Platform Launch](https://www.adobe.com/experience-platform/launch.html). The UI may not look pretty, but it exercises the fundamentals of building an extension. Each progressive step along the extension development process is saved to different branches, as follows:

* **scaffold** - The scaffold process is complete.
* **configuration** - The extension configuration view is complete.
* **show-toast-view** - The Show Toast action type view is complete.
* **show-toast-action** - The Show Toast action type library module is complete.
* **data-element-support** - Data element support has been added to the Show Toast view.
* **schema** - Schema definitions have been added for both the extension configuration and Show Toast action type.
